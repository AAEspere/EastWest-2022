# EastWest-2022
With the new year and 6 months of professional development experience, I decided to revisit this website with a new look.

What I plan to add:
-More inviting index page - improve on the slider, add more content for the index page to make it more appealing
-Improved Navigation
-Employee Portal
-Ability for users to fill out forms using the website (SQL usage)
-Improved designs!
